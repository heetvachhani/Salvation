Solving the problem of endangered species using blockchain- HackDFW2018

## Problem Description
With the problem of particular endangered species declining in number with each day, we came up with this idea of tracking these species and analyze the threats to them in their natural habitat which may be contributed due to various environmental factors like pollution, so that we can take necessary steps to ensure their safe being.

## Technologies
We solve the problem here by using Block chain technology, where we treat each species entity as a block. A blockchain is a sequential list of blocks which are secured using cryptography. We use the CryptoJS library to provide SHA-256 encryption to the blocks where each block contains information like location, temperature and other attributes related to the species entity so that we can track it for safety purposes. We also analyze the risk factor to the particular species entity using a predictive model which predicts on basis of various external factors whether there exists a risk to the species.

## Future Improvements

* Gather more data for all species, create more robust blockchain and deep learning model and making more public involvement to create more awareness.
* Implement parallel Blockchain for surrounding Eco System for better Analysis.
